# Array

A list is a sequence of several variables, grouped together under a single name. Instead of writing a program with many variables x0, x1, x2, â€¦ you can define a single variable x and access its members x[0], x[1], x[2], etc. More importantly, you can put other expressions and variables inside the square brackets, like x[i] and x[i+1]. This allows us to deal with arbitrarily large data sets using just a single small piece of code
